# üîÅ 8-Channel Relay Module

## üìò Project Overview
This project presents the design of an **8-Channel Relay Module**, a versatile switching interface for controlling multiple AC or DC devices using microcontrollers such as **Arduino, ESP32, STM32**, or **Raspberry Pi**.  
Each relay channel can be triggered independently to operate high-power devices safely from low-voltage logic signals.

## üîå Working Principle
1. **Signal Input:** A low or high logic signal (depending on configuration) is sent from the microcontroller to each channel input (IN1‚ÄìIN8).  
2. **Driver Activation:** The transistor or driver IC amplifies the signal to energize the corresponding relay coil.  
3. **Relay Operation:** Energized coils switch the contacts between **Normally Open (NO)** and **Normally Closed (NC)** terminals.  
4. **Load Switching:** The connected AC/DC devices are turned ON or OFF as per the relay state.  
5. **Indication:** Each LED glows when its respective relay is activated.

## üß† Interfacing with Arduino (Example Code)

```cpp
// Example: Sequential relay control
int relayPins[8] = {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
bool activeLow = true;

void setup() {
  for (int i=0; i<8; i++) {
    pinMode(relayPins[i], OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(relayPins[i], activeLow ? HIGH : LOW);
  }
}

void loop() {
  for (int i=0; i<8; i++) {
    digitalWrite(relayPins[i], activeLow ? LOW : HIGH);
    delay(300);
    digitalWrite(relayPins[i], activeLow ? HIGH : LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
}
