#  8 Channel Relay Module

## üîå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design of an **8 Channel Relay Driver Board** capable of controlling **multiple AC/DC loads** through microcontrollers like **Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi**.  
Each relay can be triggered individually, allowing automation of lights, fans, and other appliances.
